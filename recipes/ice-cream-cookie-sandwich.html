  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <h3>For the ice cream cookie sandwiches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pints (about 4 cups) ice cream (use any favorite brand and
      flavor)</li>
    <li>32 M&M cookies (recipe below)</li>
    <li>Optional for rolling the sides of the cookie sandwiches: mini M&Ms,
      crushed M&Ms, mini chocolate chips, sprinkles</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For the M&M cookies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 1/4 cup (390g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup, 2 sticks, (226g) unsalted butter, softened to room
      temperature</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (288g) light or dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups M&Ms, plus more for tops if desired</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <h3>M&M cookies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 365&#8451;F or 185&#8451;C. Line 2 large baking sheets
      with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Whisk together dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
      salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Add softened butter and sugars to a large mixing bowl and use an
      electric mixer to beat together on medium speed until combined and
      creamy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each
      addition until just combined. With the last egg, add in vanilla
      extract.</li>
    <li>On low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar
      mixture. Fold in the M&M’s. I have had success baking this dough without
      chilling it, but chilling the dough for at least 30 minutes will yield
      the best cookie.</li>
    <li>Drop balls of cookie dough onto the lined cookie sheet. I use about 2
      tablespoons of dough for each cookie.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 mins. Remove from the oven right when edges start
      getting golden.</li>
    <li>If desired, while the cookies are still warm, press a few extra M&M’s
      into the tops of each cookie. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet.
      Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely. Cookies stay
      fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. Before making the
      ice cream cookie sandwiches, transfer to the freezer for
      20-30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Ice cream cookie sandwich assembly</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Take one cookie and place a scoop of ice cream (about 1/3 to 1/4 cup)
      on the flat side of the cookie. Top with flat side of second cookie to
      make a sandwich.</li>
    <li>Optional: Place mini or crushed M&Ms, sprinkles or mini chocolate chips
      in a bowl or on plate. Roll sides of the sandwich in the chips or
      sprinkles. You can serve immediately or wrap tightly in plastic wrap and
      freeze.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p><em>Transferring the baked cookies to the freezer is very important.</em>
    If you try to make the sandwiches without freezing the cookies first, the
    cookies will break when you press the ice cream between them.</p>
  <p><strong>Storing ice cream cookie sandwiches:</strong> Once assembled, let
    them harden in the freezer for an hour. Then, individually wrap them in
    plastic wrap or place in reusable storage bags. They will keep in the
    freezer for about 2-3 months.</p>
