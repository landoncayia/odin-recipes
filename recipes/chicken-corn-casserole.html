  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
    <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon celery salt</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups milk (I use 2%), at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 cups chopped, cooked chicken</li>
    <li>2 cup corn kernels (fresh, frozen or canned)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Ritz cracker crumbs mixed with 1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat over to 350 degrees F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish and set
    aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sprinkle with flour
    and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add celery salt and salt,
    stir to combine. Slowly add milk, whisking constantly, until combined.
    Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute.
    Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Add chicken and corn to the sauce; stir to combine. Transfer mixture to
    the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle buttered cracker crumbs over top.</li>
    <li>Bake, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes (or until heated through and browned
    on top).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The sauce will thicken</strong> as it cooks in the oven, so
    don't cook it for too long on the stovetop. If it seems too thick before
    adding the chicken and corn, you can add a little bit of milk to thin, as
    necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Add additional seasoning or herbs</strong>, to taste. Good
    options include thyme, oregano, parsley, basil or chives.</li>
    <li>If you like a lot of Ritz crackers on your casserole, <strong>double
    the crumb topping</strong> and use 1/2 cup of cracker crumbs mixed
    with 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't have Ritz crackers?</strong> You can substitute with
    Corn Flakes cereal crumbs, crushed potato chips, or other crackers
    (such as saltines or Keebler Club crackers).</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh corn cut off the cob, canned corn, or frozen
    corn</strong> will all work in this recipe. If using frozen corn, you do
    not need to thaw it before adding it to the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Add green vegetables</strong>. In addition to the corn, try
    adding frozen peas, cooked broccoli florets, green beans, or any of your
    other favorite vegetables.</li>
  </ul>
