  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Man, aren't grilled cheese sandwiches the best? This one will positively
    satisfy your cheese and bread cravings. Credit for this recipe goes to
    <a href="">Natasha Kravchuk on Allrecipes</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>8 slices Texas toast, or thick sliced sandwich bread</li>
    <li>4 Tbps unsalted butter</li>
    <li>4 slides medium cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>4 slices Gouda cheese</li>
    <li>4 slices Havarti cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices of bread in the
      skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
    <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda.
      Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with the crisp
      sides on the outside.</li>
    <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once
      and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese. Total
      cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat on medium low for the
      breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to fully melt and
      adhere to the bread.</li>
    <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove to a
      plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next
      sandwich.</li>
  </ol>
